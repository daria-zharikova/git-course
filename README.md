You know what they say Chicken: It's what's for dinner." It's true, chicken breasts, thighs (our favorite cut), or even a whole bird all have a spot on our kitchen table. Unfortunately, that can mean falling into a dinner rut much too easily for our liking. If you’re like us and just can’t bear to make your (or your family’s) old standbys for the umpteenth time, we’ve got you. Get inspired with our list of best chicken dinner recipes—you’ll be sure to find a new weeknight favorite.
